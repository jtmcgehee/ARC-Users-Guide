# Launching ARC

## First Launch

The first time you run ARC, the application will automatically set up its internal reference databases. This happens silently in the background and only takes a moment. You won't need to configure anything.

## Subsequent Launches

Each time ARC starts, it checks for available updates. If a newer version is available, you'll see a prompt giving you the option to download the update. You can choose to update now or skip and continue working with your current version.

Once startup is complete, you'll be able to open an existing assessment or start a new one.
