# Saving and Managing Projects

## Saving Your Work

Use **Save Project** in the left sidebar (or **Ctrl+S**) to save your assessment at any time. ARC saves everything to a single **.arc file** that contains all of your project data, chemical selections, parameters, and calculation results.

## File Management Tips

- Keep .arc files organized alongside your other project documents.
- Share .arc files with colleagues so they can review or continue an assessment.
- ARC files are self-contained. No external database connections or network access are needed once the application is running.
