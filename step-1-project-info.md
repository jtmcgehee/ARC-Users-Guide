# Step 1: Project Information

The Project Information screen is the first thing you'll see when creating a new assessment. This is where you identify the project and site being evaluated.

## Project Details

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Client Name** | Yes* | The name of the client for this assessment. |
| **Project Number** | No | Your internal project or task number (e.g., PRJ-2026-001). |
| **Site Name** | Yes* | The name of the site being assessed. |

## Site Location

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Street Address** | Street address of the site. |
| **City** | City where the site is located. |
| **State** | State where the site is located. |
| **ZIP Code** | ZIP code for the site location. |

At the bottom of this section, ARC automatically records the **Date Created** and **Last Modified** timestamps for the project.

Once you've entered the project details, click **Next →** to proceed to Site Parameters.
