# Creating or Opening a Project

When ARC is ready, you have two options:

- **New Assessment**: Creates a fresh .arc project file and opens it on the Project Information screen.
- **Open Assessment**: Browse to and open an existing .arc file to continue a previous assessment.

ARC projects are saved as **.arc files**, which you can organize, share with colleagues, or archive alongside your other project deliverables.

You can also access these options at any time from the left sidebar using **Save Project** and **Open Project**.
