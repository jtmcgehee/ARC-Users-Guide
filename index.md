ARC is a desktop risk calculator designed for environmental consultants performing forward risk assessments of contaminated sites. It walks you through the full assessment workflow, from defining your site and selecting chemicals of potential concern, through exposure calculations and toxicity evaluation, to generating final risk assessment reports.

This guide covers how to get started with ARC and walks through each step of a typical assessment. Use the sidebar to navigate between sections.

*This guide is a living document and will be updated as new features are added to ARC.*
