# Troubleshooting

## First Launch Issues

If ARC fails to start on first launch, it may not have been able to set up its reference databases. Ensure that your user account has write access to your local AppData folder. Contact your IT department if you're unsure.

## Update Check Failures

If ARC cannot check for updates (e.g., due to a firewall or lack of internet access), it will continue to function normally with the current version. Updates can also be downloaded manually from the distribution site.

## General Tips

- Make sure you're running the latest version of ARC for the best experience and most current regulatory data.
- If something looks wrong with calculation results, verify that all required fields are completed on earlier screens. ARC depends on upstream data for downstream calculations.
