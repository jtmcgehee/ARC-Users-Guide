# Installation

ARC is distributed as a standalone Windows executable. No installation wizard or administrator privileges are required.

1. Download the latest version of **ARC.exe** from the official distribution site.
2. Place the file in any folder you'd like (e.g., your Desktop or a dedicated tools folder).
3. Double-click **ARC.exe** to launch the application.

That's it. No setup, no installer, no IT department required.
